Maven quickstart: https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

Create a Maven project:

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false

Pom.xml: it contains all the environment requirements and dependencies for the project.
We go to evosuite website and add the required dependencies to pom.xml

Now we want to generate evosuits test data:
mvn compile evosuite:generate
This will generate test functions inside .evosuites/best-tests
we copy the test file and scaffolding to the test directory in the project.

Evosuite Testing: 
We don't specify parameters. Evosuite will generate tests based on our classes, and these are optimized to acheive best coverage

Generate Mutants:
We use littleDarwin. the following command:
python -m littledarwin -m -b -t ./ -p ./src/main

-m is to generate mutants
-b is run the tests in the test folder on the mutants.

But we make sure to backup our original code (base program) becuase a bug in littledarwin chaning the base program

So littleDarwin will use multiple operators to generate mutants with optimized coverage. They will display to us how many mutants are generated from each operator.
By default, it is class level operators. we can specify mthod level. we can specify if we want method-level mutations. We can specify --all to use all available operators

Results of littleDarwin are in LittleDarwinResults folder, in java->com->mycompany->app
Each mutant is in a file. We don't care about the current reports, we will be able to generate subsumption graph and csv report when we use the new function that dr parsai sent us to do that.


To generate the subsumption graph:
We use the python script called FindSubsumingRelationAlone.py
How to run it:
After I finish the run on littleDarwin, I run the script as below
python FindSubsumingRelationAlone.py name_of_the_project ./LittleDarwinResults

The script will produce a csv report and .dot file which have the code for the graph for the GraphVis software.
To constrcut an image of the graph do the following:
dot -Tbmp name_of_the_dot_file.dot -o graph.bmp
